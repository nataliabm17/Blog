        content: "1. Freeze Them: Gently remove the skin of your oranges with a paring knife,and segment the oranges, removing all membranes and seeds. Store them in a freezer-safe zip-top bag for up to a year. \n 2. Make Juice: A great option to use up an abundance of oranges is to make juice (we love this juicer, $99, Amazon.) Fresh orange juice will last for 2-3 days in a clean, tightly sealed bottle or jar. \n 3. Make Concentrate: To make homemade orange juice concentrate, juice your oranges and pour into a freezer-safe plastic container. Another option is to pour your juice into ice cube trays, freeze, and pop the ice cubes into a zip-top bag. You can defrost as needed; frozen juice will last for 3-4 months in the freezer.",

        title: "Tips on how to distract yourself",
        content: "Play a Memory Game \n Look at a detailed photograph or picture (like a cityscape or other “busy” scene) for 5 to 10 seconds. Then, turn the photograph face-down and recreate the photograph in your mind, in as much detail as possible. Or, you can mentally list all the things you remember from the picture. \n Think in Categories. Choose one or two broad categories, such as “musical instruments,” “ice cream flavors,” “mammals,” or “baseball teams.” Take a minute or two to mentally list as many things from each category as you can. \n Use Math and Numbers \n Even if you aren’t a math person, numbers can help center you. Try: \n Running through a times table in your head. \n Counting backward from 100 \n Choosing a number and thinking of five ways you could make the number (6 + 11 = 17, 20 – 3 = 17, 8 × 2 + 1 = 17, etc.)\n Recite Something \n Think of a poem, song, or book passage you know by heart. Recite it quietly to yourself or in your head. If you say the words aloud, focus on the shape of each word on your lips and in your mouth. If you say the words in your head, visualize each word as you’d see it on a page.",
